# DataScience-WebApp
This is project on building my first data science web app with the Streamlit library in Python.
This app can be used to visualise the data and answer some questions related to the dataset provided.
The dataset I used for this project is Motor Vehicle Collisions in New York City. It is added to the repository.
Also with the Dataset, I have provided my project file in .py format. 
<b>Note: If you want to run the file in your system make sure python and streamlit are pre installed.</b>
